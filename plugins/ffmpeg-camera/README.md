# FFmpeg Camera Plugin for Scrypted

Add FFmpeg Camera video streams to Scrypted. Cameras often have still image snapshot URLs. To use these snapshots you will also need the [Snapshot Plugin](#/component/plugin/install/@scrypted/snapshot).

FFmpeg Cameras will need a software motion detector like [PAM-Diff](#/component/plugin/install/@scrypted/pam-diff) or [OpenCV](#/component/plugin/install/@scrypted/opencv) to enable HomeKit Secure Video.
