# Reolink Plugin for Scrypted

Reolink Cameras offer both RTMP and RTSP streams. RTMP streams are more reliable than RTSP on Reolink Cameras, but Scrypted highly recommends using RTSP streams if they are stable on your hardware. RTMP streams will be preferred by default. The defaults can be changed in a camera's Rebroadcast `Stream Management` settings.
