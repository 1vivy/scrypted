# Ring Plugin for Scrypted

The Ring Plugin bridges compatible Ring Cameras in Scrypted to HomeKit.

## Rebroadcast Plugin

Do not use this plugin with the Rebroadcast and Prebuffer plugin. The Rebroadcast
Plugin maintains an active connection to the cloud to stream video. This also
has the side effect of suppressing motion events and notifications on the Ring
app and from Scrypted itself.

## Notes

Only cameras are currently supported. Looking for a maintainer to add other devices.
