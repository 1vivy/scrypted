# Ring Plugin for Scrypted

The Ring Plugin bridges compatible Ring Cameras in Scrypted to HomeKit.

The Ring SIP stream uses PCM audio. You will be prompted to enable Transcode Audio
when using the Rebroadcast plugin.

## Notes

Only cameras are currently supported. Looking for a maintainer to add other devices.
