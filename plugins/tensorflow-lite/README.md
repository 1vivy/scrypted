# TensorFlow Lite Object Detection for Scrypted

This plugin adds object detection capabilities to any camera in Scrypted. Having a fast GPU and CPU is highly recommended. Edge TPU (Coral.ai) is also supported.

The Tensorflow Lite Plugin should only be used if you are a Scrypted NVR user. It will provide no
benefits to HomeKit, which does its own detection processing.
